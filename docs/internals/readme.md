# Internals reference

In this documentation we will describe the internals of MetaMask Snaps, for
reference while developing or debugging. This document is not intended for
developers using snaps, but for developers working on the MetaMask Snaps
platform itself.

It is recommended to read the [architecture](./architecture.md)
document first, as it provides a high-level overview of the system.
