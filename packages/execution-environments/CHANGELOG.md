## [Unreleased]

## [0.10.0]
### Changed
- Initial release, made using components from the deprecated [`@metamask/snap-workers`](https://npmjs.com/package/@metamask/snap-workers) package. ([#231](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/231))
  - Breaking changes are relative to the old package.
- **BREAKING:** Endowments must be passed to the execution environment ([#252](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/252)), ([#266](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/266))
  - Previously, default endowments were specified in the execution environment itself. Now, all endowments must be specified in the `executeSnap` RPC parameters, except for the `wallet` API object.
- Add endowments to the global `self` in addition to `window` ([#263](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/263))
