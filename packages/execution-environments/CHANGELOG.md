### Changed
- Initial release, made using components from the deprecated [`@metamask/snap-workers`](https://npmjs.com/package/@metamask/snap-workers) package. ([#231](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/231))

- Add endowments to the global `self` in addition to `window` ([#263](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/263))
