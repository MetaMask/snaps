## [Unreleased]

## [0.38.0-flask.1]
### Added
- Add support for bundling with Webpack ([#1521](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps/pull/1521))
  - For backwards compatibility, the Webpack bundler is opt-in. To use it, add
    `"bundler": "webpack"` to your snap configuration file, and follow the new
    configuration format described in the documentation.
  - The new configuration format also adds support for:
    - Setting environment variables, which are set as `process.env` values in
      the bundled code.
    - Importing WebAssembly modules (if `experimental.wasm` is enabled in the
      snap configuration file).
- Support TypeScript snap configuration files ([#1521](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps/pull/1521))

### Changed
- Release package independently ([#1600](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps/pull/1600))
  - The version of the package no longer needs to match the version of all other
    MetaMask Snaps packages.
