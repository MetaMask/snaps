## [Unreleased]

## [6.1.0]
### Added
- Add support for importing SVG, PNG, and JPEG files directly ([#2284](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps/pull/2284))
  - You can now import these files using a regular import declaration when using the Webpack-based config.
  - To opt out of this feature (i.e., to use custom image loading logic), add the following to your config:
    ```ts
    {
      features: {
        images: false,
      },
    }
    ```

### Added
- Add support for bundling with Webpack ([#1521](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps/pull/1521))
  - For backwards compatibility, the Webpack bundler is opt-in. To use it, add
    `"bundler": "webpack"` to your snap configuration file, and follow the new
    configuration format described in the documentation.
  - The new configuration format also adds support for:
    - Setting environment variables, which are set as `process.env` values in
      the bundled code.
    - Importing WebAssembly modules (if `experimental.wasm` is enabled in the
      snap configuration file).
- Support TypeScript snap configuration files ([#1521](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps/pull/1521))

### Changed
- Release package independently ([#1600](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps/pull/1600))

    MetaMask Snaps packages.
