and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.9.0]
### Added
- Transpilation configuration ([#213](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/213))
  - `mm-snap build` now takes a `--transpilationMode` argument which determines what will be transpiled by Babel during building: all source code (including dependencies), local source code only, or nothing.

### Fixed
- `mm-snap build` command when CLI is installed globally ([#216](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/216))
- Update installation command in readme ([#205](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/205))

## [0.8.0]
### Changed
- Update template snap created by `mm-snap init` ([#195](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/195))
- Exit by throwing errors instead of calling `process.exit` ([#190](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/190))

## [0.7.0]
### Added
- ESM support for `mm-snap build` ([#185](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/185))
  - The `build` command can now handle snap source code that includes ESM import / export statements. They will be transpiled to their CommonJS equivalents via Babel.

### Fixed
- Fix `mm-snap init` `src` default value ([#186](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/186))
  - It now correctly defaults to `src/index.js` instead of just `index.js`.
- Fix comment stripping ([#189](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/189))
  - Comments wouldn't be stripped under certain circumstances due to a RegEx error, details [here](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/strip-comments/pull/49).

## [0.6.3]
### Changed
- No changes this release.

## [0.6.2]
### Changed
- No changes this release.

## [0.6.1]
### Fixed
- `mm-snap init` Snap `snap_confirm` call ([#168](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/168))
  - The generated Snap was passing invalid parameters to the method.

## [0.6.0]
### Added
- Snap SVG icon support ([#163](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/163))

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Support the new Snaps publishing specification ([#140](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/140), [#160](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/160))
  - This introduces several breaking changes to how Snaps are developed, hosted, and represented at runtime. See [the specification](https://github.com/MetaMask/specifications/blob/d4a5bf5d6990bb5b02a98bd3f95a24ffb28c701c/snaps/publishing.md) and the referenced pull requests for details.
- **BREAKING:** Rename Snap `name` property to `id` ([#147](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/147))
- **BREAKING:** Update `ses` to version `^0.15.3` ([#159](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/159))
  - This will cause behavioral changes for code executed under SES, and may require modifications to code that previously executed without issues.

## [0.5.0]
### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Convert all TypeScript `interface` declarations to `type` equivalents ([#143](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/143))

## [0.4.0]
### Fixed
- Make Windows-compatible ([#131](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/131))

## [0.3.1]
### Changed
- No changes this release.

## [0.3.0]
### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Enforce consistent naming for Snaps-related functionality ([#119](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/119))

## [0.2.2]
### Fixed
- Package script issues ([#97](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/97), [#98](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/98))

## [0.2.1]
### Fixed
- Snap produced by `mm-snap init` ([#94](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/94))
  - The template used to create the "Hello, world!" snap had become outdated due to a build-time bug.

## [0.2.0]
### Changed
- Update publish scripts ([#92](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/92))

## [0.1.1]
### Added
- Missing publish scripts to new packages

## [0.1.0]
### Changed
- **(BREAKING)** Rename package to `@metamask/snaps-cli` ([#72](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/72))
  - This package was previously named [`snaps-cli`](https://npmjs.com/package/snaps-cli).
  - As part of the renaming, and due to the scope of the changes to both this package and MetaMask Snaps generally, its versioning and changelog have been reset. The original changelog can be found [here](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-cli/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

### Removed
- Example snaps ([#72](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/72))
  - The examples now live in their own package, [`@metamask/snap-examples`](https://npmjs.com/package/@metamask/snap-examples).
