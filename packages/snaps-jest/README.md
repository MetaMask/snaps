# `@metamask/snaps-jest`

This is a [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) environment for testing
[MetaMask Snaps](https://metamask.io/snaps). It consists of two parts:

- A Jest setup file, that adds matchers and other utilities to the Jest
  environment.
- A Jest test environment, that provides a browser environment for running
  Snaps, without the need to run the MetaMask extension.
