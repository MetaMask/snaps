## [Unreleased]

## [0.10.7]
### Added
- Add version history information ([#317](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/317))
- Add setInterval and clearInterval as default endowments ([#326](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/326))
- Add queue for RPC requests to starting snaps ([#288](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/288))
  - This improves the experience of invoking a starting snap, waiting for the snap to be ready instead of throwing an error.

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Bump minimum Node version from 12 to 14 ([#331](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/331))

## [0.10.6]
### Fixed
- Fix ID validation during Snap installation ([#308](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/308))

## [0.10.5]
### Added
- Add updateSnap function to SnapController ([#259](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/259))

### Fixed
- Fix issue where installation errors were repeatedly thrown ([#301](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/301))
- Fix snap crash handling ([#298](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/298))

## [0.10.3]
### Changed
- Always reinstall local snaps ([#289](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/289))

## [0.10.2]
### Fixed
- Installation failure ([#279](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/279))
  - A faulty installation script in a dependency caused the installation of this package to fail.

## [0.10.1]
### Changed
- Populate `jsonrpc` field in Snap RPC requests ([#273](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/273))

### Fixed
- Various bugs ([#275](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/275))
  - Snap fetching during installation.
  - Snap removal when cancelling a Snap installation request.

## [0.10.0]
### Added
- Allow specifying a version range when installing snap ([#250](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/250))
- Add more safe default endowments to snaps ([#252](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/252))

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Specify all endowments in the `SnapController` ([#252](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/252)), ([#266](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/266))
  - Previously, default endowments were specified in the execution environment. Now, default endowments are specified in the `SnapController`, and the execution environment will only add endowments specified by the execution command, except for the `wallet` API object.
- Disable caching when fetching local snaps ([#227](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/227))
  - This ensures that the `SnapController` will always fetch the latest snap manifest and source code during local development.

### Removed
- **BREAKING:** Remove the `PermissionController` and `SubjectMetadataController` ([#261](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/261))
  - They are part of the [`@metamask/controllers`](https://npmjs.com/package/@metamask/controllers) as of version [26.0.0](https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/releases/tag/v26.0.0) of that package.

### Fixed
- Prevent useless errors from being thrown when a snap is removed ([#215](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/215))

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Return `null` from `SnapController.getSnapState` if the snap has no state ([#203](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/203))
  - Previously it would return `undefined` in this case.
- `@metamask/controllers@^25.1.0` ([#207](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/207))

## [0.8.1]

## [0.6.2]
### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Rename endowment permission builder exports ([#171](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/171))

### Removed
- **BREAKING:** Remove the `svgIcon` property from Snap state ([#172](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/172))
  - The SVG icon content string is instead emitted with the `SnapController:snapAdded` event.

## [0.6.1]
### Changed

## [0.6.0]
### Added
- "Endowment" permissions ([#152](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/152))

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Update Snap initial states ([#126](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/126))

- Correctly identify breaking changes in [0.3.0] release ([#123](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/123))

## [0.3.0]
### Added
- Allow disabling and enabling Snaps ([#116](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/116))
  - Only enabled Snaps can be started.
- Start stopped Snaps that receive an RPC message ([#114](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/114))
- Add Snap max idle time ([#105](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/105))
  - A Snap that is idle for more than the max idle time will be stopped.

  - If a Snap stops responding, it will be forced to stop.

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** Rename package to `@metamask/snap-controllers` ([#73](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/73))

### Added
- `PluginController`: Always persist plugin `isRunning` state as `false` ([#64](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/64))
  - Plugins are not automatically running on boot, and we should never persist this state as `true`.

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** `@metamask/controllers@15.0.0` ([#66](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/66))

## [0.0.7]
### Fixed
- Store plugin states in the correct place ([#48](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/pull/48))

## [0.0.5]
### Added
- First semi-stable release.
